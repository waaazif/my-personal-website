    <h1>Short Brief of My Bio</h1>
    <p> I'm born on 12 October 2001 at Hospital Besar Kuala Lumpur (HKL). I am the third child of four siblings. In my family, I have my beloved parents on by my side with one brother and sister alongside I have one youngest sister which she is the last child in my family for now hehe ;). I lived in an urban city at Petaling Jaya, Selangor which is at Damansara Damai region. I lived at here for almost 18 years since my parents moving on here since I was three years old.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="biodata-col">
            <h3>Primary School</h3>
            <p>My whole child education from first grade to sixth grade is in S.K. Menjalara which located at the heart of Kepong city. I have completed my first real test there as in my education life that called as Ujian Penilaian Sekolah Rendah (UPSR) which I have managed to get 3A2B which is not a test result that should be boasted excessively because the test result when in my time it was only considered a safe exam result in meeting the requirement to enter the best schools in the secondary school level stream.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="biodata-col">
            <h3>Secondary School</h3>
            <p>Entering the high school level, I have successfully booked a name to enter the K.A.A. religious stream school, which is also one of the full boarding schools in Kuala Lumpur, namely SMK Segambut Jaya. However, I only finished my studies at the school when I was 15 years old, right after the completion of the form three (PT3) assessment examination. I had to move to a school close to my home due to the travel distance factor as well as due to unavoidable reasons. Therefore, I continued my studies at SMK Damansara Damai 1 until I managed to obtain a Malaysian examination certificate (SPM) with satisfactory results where with that result I had a bright opportunity to continue my studies to a higher level.</p>
        </div><div class="biodata-col">
            <h3>University (Diploma)</h3>
            <p>Having successfully passed several difficult tests and obstacles in booking a name for admission to one of the prestigious universities in Malaysia. I have managed to get a place to continue my studies at the Diploma level at Universiti Teknologi MARA Negeri Sembilan campus Rembau in Information Management course (IM110) which is here I am now struggling in completing my Diploma. But, I am very thankful that I have succeeded to such a high level in my educational life where I will never waste this opportunity because I want to give pride and sweet memories to both my parents for the success I will achieve. And I also ask for prayers from all of you who are reading my caption so that I can continue my struggle at a higher level in the future and achieve success that is worthy of pride. Amen.</p>
